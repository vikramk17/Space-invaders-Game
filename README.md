A vanilla JavaScript game with HTML and CSS.

Space Invaders is a simple grid-based game in which you as the shooter have to shoot down as many alien invaders before they get to you. Its time based game so after each step invaders gets closer to you, to win this game you need to shoot down all alien invaders. Here I build a 15*15 gird square with 30 invaders to shoot.
